# Network Security Projects

## Overview
This repository serves as a hub for various network security projects, beginning with the inaugural mini-project focused on Transposition Matrix Encryption.

### Mini-Project 1: Transposition Encryption

**Objective:**
This mini-project demonstrates the implementation of Transposition Matrix Encryption, a cryptographic technique designed to enhance data security during transmission and storage.

**Key Functionalities:**
1. **Encryption:**
   - Utilizes a transposition matrix key to rearrange the order of characters in a message.
   - Implements a modified SHA-256 hash using a character set [a-p] to enhance hashing security.
   - Appends the hash to the data before encryption for added complexity.

2. **Decryption:**
   - Reverses the encryption process, restoring the original data securely.
   - Involves the inverse application of the transposition matrix and modified SHA-256 hash.

3. **Brute Force Attack:**
   - Attempts to decrypt the data without knowing the key by trying all possible permutations of various key lengths.
   - Highlights the resilience of the encryption method against brute force attempts.

**Why Transposition Encryption:**
   - Enhances data confidentiality during transmission and storage.
   - Adds complexity to the encryption process, making it more challenging for adversaries to decipher intercepted messages.
   - Demonstrates an innovative approach to network security in the face of evolving cyber threats.
